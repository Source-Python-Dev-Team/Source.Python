Source-Python Custom Event ReadMe

This directory should be used for all custom event .res files.

If your addon contains multiple custom event .res files, it
    would be preferred if you placed them inside a folder,
    with your addon's name, inside this directory.

Otherwise, you can simply use a .res file using your addon's name.
