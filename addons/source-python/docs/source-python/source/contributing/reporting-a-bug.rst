Reporting a bug
===============

If you found a bug, please let us know! This is very important for us, because
it helps to improve Source.Python. We prefer bugs to be reported via
`Github <https://github.com/Source-Python-Dev-Team/Source.Python/issues>`_.

When reporting a bug, please give us as much information as possible. Here is
a list of points you should always try to provide:

1. A precise description of the problem.
2. A tested code snipped to reproduce the issue.

Thank you!
