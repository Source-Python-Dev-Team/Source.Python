    from core import OutputReturn

    @OnServerOutput
    def on_server_output(severity, msg):
        # Block everything starting with 'sv_' or 'mp_' from being logged.
        # This keeps the console clean in CS:GO.

        pass

.. note::

    This requires ``sp_check_for_update`` to be set to ``1`` and the current
    installation has to be versioned (no build from source).
