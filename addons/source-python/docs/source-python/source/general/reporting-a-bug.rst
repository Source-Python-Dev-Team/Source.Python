Reporting a bug
===============

If you think you found a bug, please let us know! This is very important for
us, because it helps to improve Source.Python. We prefer bugs to be reported via
`Github <https://github.com/Source-Python-Dev-Team/Source.Python/issues>`_.

When reporting a bug, please consider the following points:

1. Precisely describe your problem.
2. Provide the output of the server command ``sp info``.
3. Post your SP log file.
4. If your server crashes, add ``-debug`` to your command line and post the resulting ``debug.log``.
5. Add instructions on how to reproduce the bug.

Thank you!
